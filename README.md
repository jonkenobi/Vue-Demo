# Vue demo web application

I had 2-3 weeks to learn Vue.js from scratch on the job in 2019 July to help out our teams project immediately after that. This is a demo where I used all kinds of 
stuff I learned throughout the period. I played around using Vue's parent/props relationships, vue-router, vuex etc. There are user registration+management,
e-commerce site-ish functions.

This is a simple static web app.  

##Prerequisites
1. npm 

## Project setup
```
$git clone https://github.com/jonkenobi/Vue-Demo.git 
$cd ./Vue-Demo
$npm install
```
### Serving the webpage locally
```
$npm run serve
```
The static webpage will pop up in your browser!
 
 If that doesn't happen, check your terminal and look for  
 ```
  App running at:
   - Local:   http://localhost:PORT/
   - Network: ---------
 ```
Access http://localhost:PORT/ and you can see the demo web page.
