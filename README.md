# Vue demo web application

In 2019 July, I had 2-3 weeks to learn Vue.js from scratch at my engineer job, so I could write frontend for a customer project immediately after that. This is a demo where I used all kinds of 
stuff I learned throughout the period. I played around using Vue's parent/props relationships, vue-router, vuex etc. There are user registration+management,
e-commerce site-ish functions on the website.

This is a simple static web app.  

(I was also reading other computer science books and doing java, so more like half of the time in 2-3 weeks I was doing vue)
## Prerequisites
1. npm 

## Project setup
```
$git clone https://github.com/jonkenobi/Vue-Demo.git 
$cd ./Vue-Demo
$npm install
```
### Serving the webpage locally
```
$npm run serve
```
The static webpage will pop up in your browser!
 
 If that doesn't happen, check your terminal and look for  
 ```
  App running at:
   - Local:   http://localhost:PORT/
   - Network: ---------
 ```
Access http://localhost:PORT/ and you can see the demo web page. 

I know the commit messages and history are very messy. And the code is super messy too now I look back at it (facepalm)
This was a toy project where I was just poking around and learning Vue by myself like in a playground environment.
So I wasn't even writing commit messages properly or organizing the code. 
Would not happen in any project I work on now.
